# Jump
Jump is a browser extension which removes the search results part and send you directly to the website.
Jump contains no ads, no bloat, and no payment.

# Install
Jump can be installed by downloading the files from the repository and extracting them into a folder, after that open your Chromium based browser (Chrome, Opera, Edge and more) and typing into the search bar: `browsername://extensions`, make sure to change the `browsername` part, for Chrome its `chrome://extensions/`, for Opera (GX) it's just `extensions` and is very similar per browser. After you go to the extensions page enabled Developer mode in the top right, then press Load Unpacked and select the folder containing the extensions files.

# Usage
Jump can be used by pressing the extensions button in the top right (typically) in your browser, from there you can press Jump and it will appear, here you can type in your query, for example: `cars for sale`, this took me to a used cars website. Jump is very accurate thanks to the use of the [Serper.dev API](https://serper.dev/playground).
